Various **Q**uick **S**cripts I slap together in CC for your enjoyment

# Explanations
- `dynahex`: Dynamically load and unload terminal palette segments
- `emu-corral`: Organize your workflow in CCEMUX by setting this up in computer 0. Emu Corral gives you the ability to easily add and manage your projects, hopefully contained in individual computers.
- `gget`: github repository and submodule downloader
- `nap`: REST API -> Lua interface
- `prompt`: provides a function similar to read, with *significantly* more features.
