# qs-cc
Various **Q**uick **S**cripts I slap together in CC for your enjoyment

# Explanations
- `dynahex`: Dynamically load and unload terminal palette segments
- `emu-corral`: Organize your workflow in CCEMUX by setting this up in computer 0. Emu Corral gives you the ability to easily add and manage your projects, hopefully contained in individual computers.
- `gget`: github repository and submodule downloader
- `nap`: REST API -> Lua interface
- `prompt`: provides a function similar to read, with *significantly* more features.
- `icup`: provides means to attach and detach custom peripherals.
- `skymodem`: custom peripheral to interface with skynet as a wireless modem

## Allium
These programs were specially designed for functionality with [Allium](https://github.com/hugeblank/Allium). They could be useful elsewhere, hence their existence here.
- `color`: Parses hex codes prefixed with an ampersand into a JSON string for the command /tellraw
- `mojson`: Parses Mojang's weird NBT format into a Lua table.
